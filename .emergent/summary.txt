The previous AI engineer's work involved a complex, iterative process to build and refine a virtual try-on application. Initially, there was a significant misinterpretation of the hybrid 3D pipeline requirement, leading to the development of an enhanced 2D overlay system despite the user's explicit request for a true 3D solution outlined in the . This necessitated multiple rounds of corrections and re-implementations. Key challenges included persistent photo management issues across frontend state and backend storage, authentication bugs, and backend processing stability for AI tasks. The engineer progressively fixed these by implementing persistent photo storage in user profiles, refining authentication logic, and adding backend timeouts. The trajectory concludes with the engineer acknowledging the full scope of the real 3D pipeline from the  and beginning its proper implementation using , indicating a critical pivot towards the accurate architectural vision.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a production-ready premium apparel virtual try-on solution. This involves selecting apparel, capturing full-body photos, extracting/editing body measurements, applying these to an identity-preserving avatar, virtually trying on clothes, and generating precise size recommendations. The application needs a full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) with an open API backend, supporting public and brand-specific modes, a dark, elegant UI/UX, and robust authentication (login, registration, password reset). Crucially, the virtual try-on must preserve the user's exact appearance, utilizing an AI-Powered Image Synthesis approach. An Hybrid 3D Approach is the default, with a  solution for premium users. The user explicitly demanded a real, production-ready Hybrid 3D pipeline, explicitly outlining a 4-step process: 3D body modeling, 3D garment fitting with physics, AI rendering from 3D, and AI post-processing.

-   ****: The main FastAPI application. It defines API endpoints for user management, product catalog, measurement extraction, and virtual try-on. It has undergone extensive modification to integrate with  and subsequently , managing the overall try-on process flow and error handling. Recently, it was updated to handle concurrent processing and set timeouts for try-on requests.
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models and MongoDB schemas. Updated to include a  field in the  model to store the user's captured image persistently.
-   ****: Manages MongoDB interactions. Updated to reflect changes in  and includes  for saving base64 photo data.
-   ****: Handles authentication logic (JWT, bcrypt).
-   ****: Encapsulates the core virtual try-on logic. This file has been significantly refactored multiple times. Initially containing mock data, then an enhanced 2D overlay, it was later updated to lazily load heavy AI dependencies. Most recently, it was modified to integrate with  and is now being updated to use . It also includes fallback mechanisms.
-   ****: *Newly created file* (). This file was intended to house a pure Python 3D pipeline solution after  installation failed. It implements SMPL-like body modeling, physics simulation, and 3D-to-2D rendering. It was improved to provide more realistic fitting and blending.
-   ****: *Newly created file* (). This file is currently being created to implement the REAL Hybrid 3D Pipeline as per the detailed PDF requirements, indicating a major architectural shift from previous attempts.
-   ****: Python dependencies.  was added to resolve import issues.
-   ****: Main React component for routing.
-   ****: (Moved from  to ). Provides authentication context. Underwent multiple fixes to correctly set authorization headers, handle token validation, update user data (including ), and prevent 401 Unauthorized errors.
-   ****: The core try-on interface. Received extensive modifications:
    -   Implemented a multi-step workflow.
    -   Fixed photo required and redundant photo capture issues by checking for existing measurements and integrating .
    -   Added  and  helper functions.
    -   Implemented logic to use saved profile photos or retake a new one, ensuring new photos replace old ones and regenerate measurements.
-   ****: Debugging tool for camera.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just identified a critical architectural gap: the currently implemented hybrid 3D pipeline was an enhanced 2D overlay system and did not adhere to the user's explicit  requirements for a true 3D approach. The user confirmed their dissatisfaction and reiterated the need for the genuine 3D pipeline.

The AI engineer has now acknowledged this fundamental misstep and is actively pivoting to implement the *real* production-ready Hybrid 3D pipeline. This involves:
1.  Acknowledging that the before picture was old and the try-on result was terrible.
2.  Re-examining the  requirements for the correct 3D pipeline (MediaPipe + SMPL, PyBullet, Blender Cycles, Stable Diffusion).
3.  Fixing the photo replacement bug in the frontend.
4.  Creating a new file:  to house the new, correct 3D implementation.
5.  The very last action in the trajectory is the AI starting to update  to utilize this newly created . This signifies the beginning of integrating the correct, PDF-compliant 3D processing into the application's backend, replacing all previous attempts.
