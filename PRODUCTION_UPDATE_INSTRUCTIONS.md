# Production Server Update Instructions

## Issue Identified
The production server is still using **SAFE mode** instead of the **Comprehensive Try-On system**. The logs show:
```
[SAFE] ⚡ Starting SAFE clothing overlay (ZERO AI INPAINTING)
```

This means the production server is running an older version of the code.

## Root Cause
- Local code has `USE_COMPREHENSIVE_TRYON = True` (line 315 in enhanced_pipeline_controller.py)
- Production server at `/home/mat_a/virtualfit/backend/` is running outdated code
- The comprehensive try-on system is not being used, causing identical before/after images

## Required Actions

### 1. Update Production Server Code
```bash
# On production server
cd /home/mat_a/virtualfit/backend/
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Verify Configuration
Check that the production server has the correct configuration:
```bash
grep -n "USE_COMPREHENSIVE_TRYON.*True" /home/mat_a/virtualfit/backend/src/core/enhanced_pipeline_controller.py
```
Should return: `USE_COMPREHENSIVE_TRYON = True`

### 3. Restart Production Server
```bash
# Stop current server
pkill -f "uvicorn.*server:app"

# Start updated server
cd /home/mat_a/virtualfit/backend/
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level info
```

### 4. Verify Fix
After restart, the logs should show:
```
[COMPREHENSIVE] ⚡ Starting COMPREHENSIVE virtual try-on (REPLACING SAFE MODE)
```
Instead of:
```
[SAFE] ⚡ Starting SAFE clothing overlay (ZERO AI INPAINTING)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Virtual try-on will use the comprehensive region-based system
- Before and after images will be different (clothing will actually change)
- Logs will show comprehensive processing instead of SAFE mode
- Modified regions will be properly processed while preserving face, arms, and background

## Verification Steps
1. Test a virtual try-on request
2. Check logs for `[COMPREHENSIVE]` messages instead of `[SAFE]` messages
3. Verify that result images show actual clothing changes
4. Confirm that face and background are preserved while clothing regions are modified

## Current Status
- ❌ Production server using outdated SAFE mode
- ✅ Local code has comprehensive try-on system implemented
- ⏳ Waiting for production server update and restart
