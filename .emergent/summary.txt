The previous AI engineer's work trajectory can be divided into distinct phases. Initially, there was a misdiagnosis of the codebase, leading the AI to believe it was a basic app, despite the user's detailed description of an already comprehensive virtual try-on solution. This led to a full rebuild of the application from scratch, encompassing both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React) components for authentication, user profiles, and the core try-on functionality.

A significant portion of the subsequent interactions involved iterative debugging and refinement of the frontend UI/UX. Key challenges included fixing a persistent blank camera display (rooted in React lifecycle issues), implementing a detailed 5-step workflow with editable body measurements and real-time size recommendations, and resolving issues with product and result image loading. Crucially, the hybrid 3D pipeline and fal.ai integration for result generation were initially implemented as placeholders/mocks, which the user identified and strongly corrected, demanding a production-ready solution. The work concluded with the AI starting to implement the *real* virtual try-on engine, pivoting from mock data to a genuine AI pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a production-ready retail premium apparel virtual try-on solution. Core features include: selecting apparel from a catalog, capturing full-body pictures, extracting and editing body measurements, mimicking these measurements for an avatar (identity-preserving), virtually trying on clothes, and suggesting precise sizes. The solution requires a full-stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) architecture with an open API backend, supporting public and brand-specific modes.

Specific features and requirements:
*   Dark, elegant UI/UX theme.
*   User profiles to store measurements, with options to use stored or recapture.
*   Login, registration, and password reset functionality.
*   Camera-first onboarding for new users, with a countdown before capture, and the ability to upload user and clothing pictures.
*   How It Works section, demo video modal.
*   Measurements displayed in inches/pounds, with accurate size recommendations.
*   **Critical Requirement**: Virtual try-on must preserve the user's exact appearance, showing the user in the clothing, not a generic avatar. This necessitated an AI-Powered Image Synthesis approach.
*   An alternative, more cost-effective virtual try-on approach (Hybrid 3D Approach) to be implemented as the default option, while preserving the existing fal.ai solution as a premium user-selectable option.
*   **Current State**: The system's hybrid 3D pipeline for result generation was found to be a mock implementation, and the user explicitly demanded a full-fledged, production-ready solution.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI application. Defines API endpoints for user authentication, profile management, product catalog, measurement extraction, and the virtual try-on logic. This file was initially rebuilt from a basic state to include all comprehensive features and has undergone multiple modifications for API contracts, error handling, and integration of AI pipeline logic (initially mock, now being updated to use ).
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schemas (e.g., User, Product, TryonResult). Updated to support new functionalities and data requirements.
-   ****: Manages MongoDB connection and CRUD operations for users, products, and try-on history. Updated primarily to reflect changes in  and new product seeding.
-   ****: Handles JWT token generation, verification, and password hashing (bcrypt). Integrated to secure API routes for login/registration.
-   ****: *Newly created file*. This file is intended to encapsulate the real production-ready hybrid 3D virtual try-on pipeline and fal.ai integration logic, in response to the user's demand for a non-mock solution.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies. , , , ,  were added during the rebuild.
-   ****: Main React component managing global layout and routing. Configured routes for , , , , and .
-   ****: Global styles for the application. Applied a dark elegant theme and fixed various UI elements.
-   ****: (Likely created during the rebuild) Provides authentication context to React components, handling login state and token management.
-   ****: Entry point, showcasing product features. Updated with How It Works and a demo video modal.
-   ****: User login interface. Features Forgot password? link and input styling fixes.
-   ****: User registration interface. Primarily for input field styling fixes.
-   ****: User's personalized dashboard. Implemented camera-first onboarding, fixed numerous camera display issues, and incorporated debugging tools.
-   ****: The core virtual try-on interface. Underwent extensive modifications:
    -   Implemented a 5-step workflow: Photo Capture -> Measurement Editing -> Product Selection -> Configuration -> Results.
    -   Integrated camera capture with countdown, photo upload, and measurement extraction.
    -   Added interactive, editable measurement fields with real-time dynamic size recommendations.
    -   Resolved issues with photo persistence (transitioned to Data URLs) and product image loading (using Unsplash).
    -   Incorporated UI/UX enhancements, debugging mechanisms, and later removed debug elements for a clean interface.
    -   Fixed  state variable declaration.
-   ****: A simple standalone HTML page created for isolating and debugging camera functionality outside the React application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just started a critical pivot from a mock virtual try-on pipeline to a **production-ready, real implementation** of both the Hybrid 3D Approach and fal.ai integration. This change was a direct response to the user's explicit feedback that the current hybrid 3D pipeline was merely using placeholder images and not actually processing the user's photo with the selected apparel.

The current work involves:
1.  Acknowledging and apologizing for the mock implementation, committing to building the *real* solution as specified in the PDF.
2.  Installing new Python dependencies () in the backend, suggesting new libraries are required for the actual AI pipelines.
3.  Creating a new file: . This file is designated to contain the actual complex logic for both the hybrid 3D pipeline and the  integration, moving away from  for this core AI functionality.
4.  The last logged action indicates the AI was in the process of updating  to utilize this newly created . This signifies the beginning of integrating the actual AI processing into the application's backend. The frontend is in a functional state for user interaction, but the core try-on computation logic is currently under active development and transition.
